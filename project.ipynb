    "## About the Assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction to Language Models (LMs)\n",
    "\n",
    "You've almost certainly heard about ChatGPT, a large language model developed by OpenAI. It is designed to generate human-like responses to natural language input.\n",
    "\n",
    "<center><img src=\"imgs/chatgpt.png\" width=60%>Inception!</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will build your own [language models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_model), using publicly-available books found on [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org). Language models attempt to capture the likelihood that a given sequence of words occur in a given collection of texts, known as a \"corpus.\" For instance, a language model can assign probabilities to the sentences `'when I drink Coke I smile'` and `'when I drink pizza I smile'`. One would expect the former sentence to have a higher probability than the former 😊.\n",
    "\n",
    "As with all statistical models, the true data generating process is unknown to us, so all we can do is **estimate** the probabilities of sentences. For example, one might estimate the probability of a sentence as simply the product of the empirical probabilities (i.e., the number of times a word is observed in a dataset divided by the number of words in that dataset). In the above example, we may have:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(\\text{when I drink Coke I smile}) = P(\\text{when}) \\cdot P(\\text{I}) \\cdot P(\\text{drink}) \\cdot P(\\text{Coke}) \\cdot P(\\text{I}) \\cdot P(\\text{smile})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll look at several estimation methods in this project (including the one above); as you'll see, some are more sophisticated than others. Don't worry – we'll re-introduce all of the relevant mathematics as it becomes necessary throughout the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tokenizing a Corpus\n",
    "\n",
    "To train a language model on a corpus, we must break the corpus into a sequence of words. In reality though, the sequences are not made up entirely of words, but rather more general terms called *tokens*, which may include punctuation and other terms. The process of separating a corpus into its tokens is called **tokenization**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below are a few examples of tokens that aren't \"words\":\n",
    "\n",
    "* Punctuation. For example, the period makes sense as a token, as certain words tend to end sentences (i.e. appear right before a `'.'`), while other words tend to begin sentences (i.e. appear right after a `'.'`).\n",
    "* We have special \"START\" and \"END\" tokens that begin and end every word sequence (in our case, paragraphs of words in a given book). These make sense as tokens, as certain words may tend to begin and end paragraphs. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is useful for the tokens used to represent START and END to be single characters that can never be found in the text of the book you use to create your language model. Thus, you will use two ASCII hidden \"[control characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C0_and_C1_control_codes#C0_(ASCII_and_derivatives))\":\n",
    "* For START, you will use the character `'\\x02'`, which refers to the \"beginning of text\".\n",
    "* For END, you will use the character `'\\x03'`, which refers to the \"end of text\".\n",
    "\n",
    "### Checking Your Work for Correctness\n",
    "\n",
    "To build a language model, you will need to perform several steps, from data cleaning to implementing mathematical formulas. **Things will get messy, and it can be difficult to assess the correctness of your work.**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `grader.check` public notebook tests will be informative, but as per usual, they won't guarantee that your code is correct.\n",
    "- Run your functions on **real books** taken from [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/) and make sure that their behavior looks correct. After selecting a book ([example](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/68085/)), click the \"Plain Text UTF-8\" link to find the book's text ([example](https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/68085/pg68085.txt))."

reproduce approximately, in modern\\r\\nmeasures, the venerable epic, Beowulf. _Approximately_, I repeat; for a\\r\\nvery close reproduction of Anglo-Saxon verse would, to a large extent, be\\r\\nprose to a modern ear.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Heyne-Socin text and glossary have been closely followed. Occasionally\\r\\na deviation has been made, but always for what seemed good and sufficient\\r\\nreason. The translator does not aim to be an editor. Once in a while,\\r\\nhowever, he has added a conjecture of his own to the emendations quoted\\r\\nfrom the criticisms of other students of the poem.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis work is addressed to two classes of readers. From both of these alike\\r\\nthe translator begs sympathy and co-operation. The Anglo-Saxon scholar he\\r\\nhopes to please by adhering faithfully to the original. The student of\\r\\nEnglish literature he aims to interest by giving him, in modern garb, the\\r\\nmost ancient epic of our race. This is a bold and venturesome undertaking;\\r\\nand yet there must be some students of the Teutonic past willing to follow\\r\\neven a daring guide, if they may read in modern phrases of the sorrows of\\r\\nHrothgar, of the prowess of Beowulf, and of the feelings that stirred the\\r\\nhearts of our forefathers in their primeval homes.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn order to please the larger class of readers, a regular cadence has been\\r\\nused, a measure which, while retaining the essential characteristics of\\r\\nthe original, permits the reader to see ahead of him in reading.\\r\\n\\r\\nPerhaps every Anglo-Saxon scholar has his own theory as to how Beowulf\\r\\nshould be translated. Some have given us prose versions of what we believe\\r\\nto be a great poem. Is it any reflection on our honored Kemble and Arnold\\r\\nto say that their translations fail to show a layman that Beowulf is\\r\\njustly called our first _epic_? Of those translators who have used verse,\\r\\nseveral have written from what would seem a mistaken point of view. Is it\\r\\nproper, for instance, that the grave and solemn speeches of Beowulf and\\r\\nHrothgar be put in ballad measures, tripping lightly and airily along? Or,\\r\\nagain, is it fitting that the rough martial music of Anglo-Saxon verse be\\r\\ninterpreted to us in the smooth measures of modern blank verse? Do we hear\\r\\nwhat has been beautifully called \"the clanging tread of a warrior in\\r\\nmail\"?\\r\\n\\r\\n[viii]\\r\\n\\r\\nOf all English translations of Beowulf, that of Professor Garnett alone\\r\\ngives any adequate idea of the chief characteristics of this great\\r\\nTeutonic epic.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe measure used in the present translation is believed to be as near a\\r\\nreproduction of the original as modern English affords. The cadences\\r\\nclosely resemble those used by Browning in some of his most striking\\r\\npoems. The four stresses of the Anglo-Saxon verse are retained, and as\\r\\nmuch thesis and anacrusis is allowed as is consistent with a regular\\r\\ncadence. Alliteration has been used to a large extent; but it was thought\\r\\nthat modern ears would hardly tolerate it on every line. End-rhyme has\\r\\nbeen used occasionally; internal rhyme, sporadically. Both have some\\r\\nwarrant in Anglo-Saxon poetry. (For end-rhyme, see 1_53, 1_54; for\\r\\ninternal rhyme, 2_21, 6_40.)\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat Gummere[1] calls the \"rime-giver\" has been studiously kept; _viz._,\\r\\nthe first accented syllable in the second half-verse always carries the\\r\\nalliteration; and the last accented syllable alliterates only\\r\\nsporadically. Alternate alliteration is occasionally used as in the\\r\\noriginal. (See 7_61, 8_5.)\\r\\n\\r\\nNo two accented syllables have been brought together, except occasionally\\r\\nafter a cæsural pause. (See 2_19 and 12_1.) Or, scientifically speaking,\\r\\nSievers\\'s C type has been avoided as not consonant with the plan of\\r\\ntranslation. Several of his types, however, constantly occur; _e.g._ A and\\r\\na variant (/\\xa0x | /\\xa0x) (/\\xa0x\\xa0x | /\\xa0x); B and a variant (x\\xa0/ | x\\xa0/\\xa0) (x\\xa0x\\xa0/ |\\r\\nx\\xa0/\\xa0); a variant of D (/\\xa0x | /\\xa0x\\xa0x); E (/\\xa0x\\xa0x | /\\xa0). Anacrusis gives\\r\\nfurther variety to the types used in the translation.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe parallelisms of the original have been faithfully preserved. (_E.g._,\\r\\n1_16 and 1_17: \"Lord\" and \"Wielder of Glory\"; 1_30, 1_31, 1_32; 2_12 and\\r\\n2_13; 2_27 and 2_28; 3_5 and 3_6.) Occasionally, some loss has been\\r\\nsustained; but, on the other hand, a gain has here and there been made.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe effort has been made to give a decided flavor of archaism to the\\r\\ntranslation. All words not in keeping with the spirit of the poem have\\r\\nbeen avoided. Again, though many archaic words have been used, there are\\r\\nnone, it is believed, which are not found in standard modern poetry.\\r\\n\\r\\n[ix]\\r\\n\\r\\nWith these preliminary remarks, it will not be amiss to give an outline of\\r\\nthe story of the poem.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n_THE STORY._\\r\\n\\r\\n_Hrothgar, king of the Danes, or Scyldings, builds a great mead-hall, or\\r\\npalace, in which he hopes to feast his liegemen and to give them presents.\\r\\nThe joy of king and retainers is, however, of short duration. Grendel, the\\r\\nmonster, is seized with hateful jealousy. He cannot brook the sounds of\\r\\njoyance that reach him down in his fen-dwelling near the hall. Oft and\\r\\nanon he goes to the joyous building, bent on direful mischief. Thane after\\r\\nthane is ruthlessly carried off and devoured, while no one is found strong\\r\\nenough and bold enough to cope with the monster. For twelve years he\\r\\npersecutes Hrothgar and his vassals._\\r\\n\\r\\n_Over sea, a day\\'s voyage off, Beowulf, of the Geats, nephew of Higelac,\\r\\nking of the Geats, hears of Grendel\\'s doings and of Hrothgar\\'s misery. He\\r\\nresolves to crush the fell monster and relieve the aged king. With\\r\\nfourteen chosen companions, he sets sail for Dane-land. Reaching that\\r\\ncountry, he soon persuades Hrothgar of his ability to help him. The hours\\r\\nthat elapse before night are spent in beer-drinking and conversation. When\\r\\nHrothgar\\'s bedtime comes he leaves the hall in charge of Beowulf, telling\\r\\nhim that never before has he given to another the absolute wardship of his\\r\\npalace. All retire to rest, Beowulf, as it were, sleeping upon his arms._\\r\\n\\r\\n_Grendel comes, the great march-stepper, bearing God\\'s anger. He seizes\\r\\nand kills one of the sleeping warriors. Then he advances towards Beowulf.\\r\\nA fierce and desperate hand-to-hand struggle ensues. No arms are used,\\r\\nboth combatants trusting to strength and hand-grip. Beowulf tears\\r\\nGrendel\\'s shoulder from its socket, and the monster retreats to his den,\\r\\nhowling and yelling with agony and fury. The wound is fatal._\\r\\n\\r\\n_The next morning, at early dawn, warriors in numbers flock to the hall\\r\\nHeorot, to hear the news. Joy is boundless. Glee runs high. Hrothgar and\\r\\nhis retainers are lavish of gratitude and of gifts._\\r\\n\\r\\n_Grendel\\'s mother, however, comes the next night to avenge his death. She\\r\\nis furious and raging. While Beowulf is sleeping in a room somewhat apart\\r\\n[x] from the quarters of the other warriors, she seizes one of Hrothgar\\'s\\r\\nfavorite counsellors, and carries him off and devours him. Beowulf is\\r\\ncalled. Determined to leave Heorot entirely purified, he arms himself, and\\r\\ngoes down to look for the female monster. After traveling through the\\r\\nwaters many hours, he meets her near the sea-bottom. She drags him to her\\r\\nden. There he sees Grendel lying dead. After a desperate and almost fatal\\r\\nstruggle with the woman, he slays her, and swims upward in triumph, taking\\r\\nwith him Grendel\\'s head._\\r\\n\\r\\n_Joy is renewed at Heorot. Congratulations crowd upon the victor. Hrothgar\\r\\nliterally pours treasures into the lap of Beowulf; and it is agreed among\\r\\nthe vassals of the king that Beowulf will be their next liegelord._\\r\\n\\r\\n_Beowulf leaves Dane-land. Hrothgar weeps and laments at his departure._\\r\\n\\r\\n_When the hero arrives in his own land, Higelac treats him as a\\r\\ndistinguished guest. He is the hero of the hour._\\r\\n\\r\\n_Beowulf subsequently becomes king of his own people, the Geats. After he\\r\\nhas been ruling for fifty years, his own neighborhood is wofully harried\\r\\nby a fire-spewing dragon. Beowulf determines to kill him. In the ensuing\\r\\nstruggle both Beowulf and the dragon are slain. The grief of the Geats is\\r\\ninexpressible. They determine, however, to leave nothing undone to honor\\r\\nthe memory of their lord. A great funeral-pyre is built, and his body is\\r\\nburnt. Then a memorial-barrow is made, visible from a great distance, that\\r\\nsailors afar may be constantly reminded of the prowess of the national\\r\\nhero of Geatland._\\r\\n\\r\\n_The poem closes with a glowing tribute to his bravery, his gentleness,\\r\\nhis goodness of heart, and his generosity._\\r\\n\\r\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is the devout desire of this translator to hasten the day when the\\r\\nstory of Beowulf shall be as familiar to English-speaking peoples as that\\r\\nof the Iliad. Beowulf is our first great epic. It is an epitomized history\\r\\nof the life of the Teutonic races. It brings vividly before us our\\r\\nforefathers of pre-Alfredian eras, in their love of war, of sea, and of\\r\\nadventure.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy special thanks are due to Professors Francis A.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\\r\\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\\r\\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\\r\\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\\r\\npeople in all walks of life.\\r\\n\\r\\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\\r\\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\\'s\\r\\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\\r\\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\\r\\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\\r\\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\\r\\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\\r\\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\\r\\nand the Foundation web page at https://www.pglaf.org.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\\r\\nFoundation\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\\r\\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\\r\\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\\r\\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation\\'s EIN or federal tax identification\\r\\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\\r\\nhttps://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\\r\\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\\r\\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state\\'s laws.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Foundation\\'s principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\\r\\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\\r\\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\\r\\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\\r\\nbusiness@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact\\r\\ninformation can be found at the Foundation\\'s web site and official\\r\\npage at https://pglaf.org\\r\\n\\r\\nFor additional contact information:\\r\\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\\r\\n     Chief Executive and Director\\r\\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\\r\\nLiterary Archive Foundation\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\\r\\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\\r\\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\\r\\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\\r\\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\\r\\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\\r\\nstatus with the IRS.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\\r\\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\\r\\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\\r\\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\\r\\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\\r\\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\\r\\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\\r\\nparticular state visit https://pglaf.org\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\\r\\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\\r\\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\\r\\napproach us with offers to donate.\\r\\n\\r\\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\\r\\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\\r\\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\\r\\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\\r\\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\\r\\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: https://pglaf.org/donate\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\\r\\nworks.\\r\\n\\r\\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\\r\\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\\r\\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\\r\\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\\r\\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\\r\\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\\r\\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\\r\\n\\r\\n     https://www.gutenberg.org\\r\\n\\r\\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\\r\\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\r\\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\\r\\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\\r\\n'"

for a\\nvery close reproduction of Anglo-Saxon verse would, to a large extent, be\\nprose to a modern ear.\\n\\nThe Heyne-Socin text and glossary have been closely followed. Occasionally\\na deviation has been made, but always for what seemed good and sufficient\\nreason. The translator does not aim to be an editor. Once in a while,\\nhowever, he has added a conjecture of his own to the emendations quoted\\nfrom the criticisms of other students of the poem.\\n\\nThis work is addressed to two classes of readers. From both of these alike\\nthe translator begs sympathy and co-operation. The Anglo-Saxon scholar he\\nhopes to please by adhering faithfully to the original. The student of\\nEnglish literature he aims to interest by giving him, in modern garb, the\\nmost ancient epic of our race. This is a bold and venturesome undertaking;\\nand yet there must be some students of the Teutonic past willing to follow\\neven a daring guide, if they may read in modern phrases of the sorrows of\\nHrothgar, of the prowess of Beowulf, and of the feelings that stirred the\\nhearts of our forefathers in their primeval homes.\\n\\nIn order to please the larger class of readers, a regular cadence has been\\nused, a measure which, while retaining the essential characteristics of\\nthe original, permits the reader to see ahead of him in reading.\\n\\nPerhaps every Anglo-Saxon scholar has his own theory as to how Beowulf\\nshould be translated. Some have given us prose versions of what we believe\\nto be a great poem. Is it any reflection on our honored Kemble and Arnold\\nto say that their translations fail to show a layman that Beowulf is\\njustly called our first _epic_? Of those translators who have used verse,\\nseveral have written from what would seem a mistaken point of view. Is it\\nproper, for instance, that the grave and solemn speeches of Beowulf and\\nHrothgar be put in ballad measures, tripping lightly and airily along? Or,\\nagain, is it fitting that the rough martial music of Anglo-Saxon verse be\\ninterpreted to us in the smooth measures of modern blank verse? Do we hear\\nwhat has been beautifully called \"the clanging tread of a warrior in\\nmail\"?\\n\\n[viii]\\n\\nOf all English translations of Beowulf, that of Professor Garnett alone\\ngives any adequate idea of the chief characteristics of this great\\nTeutonic epic.\\n\\nThe measure used in the present translation is believed to be as near a\\nreproduction of the original as modern English affords. The cadences\\nclosely resemble those used by Browning in some of his most striking\\npoems. The four stresses of the Anglo-Saxon verse are retained, and as\\nmuch thesis and anacrusis is allowed as is consistent with a regular\\ncadence. Alliteration has been used to a large extent; but it was thought\\nthat modern ears would hardly tolerate it on every line. End-rhyme has\\nbeen used occasionally; internal rhyme, sporadically. Both have some\\nwarrant in Anglo-Saxon poetry. (For end-rhyme, see 1_53, 1_54; for\\ninternal rhyme, 2_21, 6_40.)\\n\\nWhat Gummere[1] calls the \"rime-giver\" has been studiously kept; _viz._,\\nthe first accented syllable in the second half-verse always carries the\\nalliteration; and the last accented syllable alliterates only\\nsporadically. Alternate alliteration is occasionally used as in the\\noriginal. (See 7_61, 8_5.)\\n\\nNo two accented syllables have been brought together, except occasionally\\nafter a cæsural pause. (See 2_19 and 12_1.) Or, scientifically speaking,\\nSievers\\'s C type has been avoided as not consonant with the plan of\\ntranslation. Several of his types, however, constantly occur; _e.g._ A and\\na variant (/\\xa0x | /\\xa0x) (/\\xa0x\\xa0x | /\\xa0x); B and a variant (x\\xa0/ | x\\xa0/\\xa0) (x\\xa0x\\xa0/ |\\nx\\xa0/\\xa0); a variant of D (/\\xa0x | /\\xa0x\\xa0x); E (/\\xa0x\\xa0x | /\\xa0). Anacrusis gives\\nfurther variety to the types used in the translation.\\n\\nThe parallelisms of the original have been faithfully preserved. (_E.g._,\\n1_16 and 1_17: \"Lord\" and \"Wielder of Glory\"; 1_30, 1_31, 1_32; 2_12 and\\n2_13; 2_27 and 2_28; 3_5 and 3_6.) Occasionally, some loss has been\\nsustained; but, on the other hand, a gain has here and there been made.\\n\\nThe effort has been made to give a decided flavor of archaism to the\\ntranslation. All words not in keeping with the spirit of the poem have\\nbeen avoided. Again, though many archaic words have been used, there are\\nnone, it is believed, which are not found in standard modern poetry.\\n\\n[ix]\\n\\nWith these preliminary remarks, it will not be amiss to give an outline of\\nthe story of the poem.\\n\\n\\n_THE STORY._\\n\\n_Hrothgar, king of the Danes, or Scyldings, builds a great mead-hall, or\\npalace, in which he hopes to feast his liegemen and to give them presents.\\nThe joy of king and retainers is, however, of short duration. Grendel, the\\nmonster, is seized with hateful jealousy. He cannot brook the sounds of\\njoyance that reach him down in his fen-dwelling near the hall. Oft and\\nanon he goes to the joyous building, bent on direful mischief. Thane after\\nthane is ruthlessly carried off and devoured, while no one is found strong\\nenough and bold enough to cope with the monster. For twelve years he\\npersecutes Hrothgar and his vassals._\\n\\n_Over sea, a day\\'s voyage off, Beowulf, of the Geats, nephew of Higelac,\\nking of the Geats, hears of Grendel\\'s doings and of Hrothgar\\'s misery. He\\nresolves to crush the fell monster and relieve the aged king. With\\nfourteen chosen companions, he sets sail for Dane-land. Reaching that\\ncountry, he soon persuades Hrothgar of his ability to help him. The hours\\nthat elapse before night are spent in beer-drinking and conversation. When\\nHrothgar\\'s bedtime comes he leaves the hall in charge of Beowulf, telling\\nhim that never before has he given to another the absolute wardship of his\\npalace. All retire to rest, Beowulf, as it were, sleeping upon his arms._\\n\\n_Grendel comes, the great march-stepper, bearing God\\'s anger. He seizes\\nand kills one of the sleeping warriors. Then he advances towards Beowulf.\\nA fierce and desperate hand-to-hand struggle ensues. No arms are used,\\nboth combatants trusting to strength and hand-grip. Beowulf tears\\nGrendel\\'s shoulder from its socket, and the monster retreats to his den,\\nhowling and yelling with agony and fury. The wound is fatal._\\n\\n_The next morning, at early dawn, warriors in numbers flock to the hall\\nHeorot, to hear the news. Joy is boundless. Glee runs high. Hrothgar and\\nhis retainers are lavish of gratitude and of gifts._\\n\\n_Grendel\\'s mother, however, comes the next night to avenge his death. She\\nis furious and raging. While Beowulf is sleeping in a room somewhat apart\\n[x] from the quarters of the other warriors, she seizes one of Hrothgar\\'s\\nfavorite counsellors, and carries him off and devours him. Beowulf is\\ncalled. Determined to leave Heorot entirely purified, he arms himself, and\\ngoes down to look for the female monster. After traveling through the\\nwaters many hours, he meets her near the sea-bottom. She drags him to her\\nden. There he sees Grendel lying dead. After a desperate and almost fatal\\nstruggle with the woman, he slays her, and swims upward in triumph, taking\\nwith him Grendel\\'s head._\\n\\n_Joy is renewed at Heorot. Congratulations crowd upon the victor. Hrothgar\\nliterally pours treasures into the lap of Beowulf; and it is agreed among\\nthe vassals of the king that Beowulf will be their next liegelord._\\n\\n_Beowulf leaves Dane-land. Hrothgar weeps and laments at his departure._\\n\\n_When the hero arrives in his own land, Higelac treats him as a\\ndistinguished guest. He is the hero of the hour._\\n\\n_Beowulf subsequently becomes king of his own people, the Geats. After he\\nhas been ruling for fifty years, his own neighborhood is wofully harried\\nby a fire-spewing dragon. Beowulf determines to kill him. In the ensuing\\nstruggle both Beowulf and the dragon are slain. The grief of the Geats is\\ninexpressible. They determine, however, to leave nothing undone to honor\\nthe memory of their lord. A great funeral-pyre is built, and his body is\\nburnt. Then a memorial-barrow is made, visible from a great distance, that\\nsailors afar may be constantly reminded of the prowess of the national\\nhero of Geatland._\\n\\n_The poem closes with a glowing tribute to his bravery, his gentleness,\\nhis goodness of heart, and his generosity._\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nIt is the devout desire of this translator to hasten the day when the\\nstory of Beowulf shall be as familiar to English-speaking peoples as that\\nof the Iliad. Beowulf is our first great epic. It is an epitomized history\\nof the life of the Teutonic races. It brings vividly before us our\\nforefathers of pre-Alfredian eras, in their love of war, of sea, and of\\nadventure.\\n\\nMy special thanks are due to Professors Francis A. March and James A.\\nHarrison, for advice, sympathy, and assistance.\\n\\n                                                        J.L.

    "* The start of every paragraph is represented in the list with the single character `'\\x02'` (standing for START).\n",
    "* The end of every paragraph is represented in the list with the single character `'\\x03'` (standing for STOP).\n",
    "* Tokens include *no* whitespace.\n",
    "* Two or more newlines count as a paragraph break, and whitespace (e.g. multiple newlines) between two paragraphs of text do not appear as tokens.\n",

    "## Part 2: Creating Baseline Language Models 📕\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we're able to tokenize a corpus, it is time to start building language models (LM).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we will build three different language models. They all operate under the premise of assigning probabilities to sentences. Given a sentence – that is, a sequence of tokens $w = w_1\\ldots w_n$ – we want to be able to compute the **probability** that sentence is used: \n",
    "$$P(w) = P(w_1,\\ldots,w_n)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "However, sentences are built from tokens, and the likelihood that a token occurs where it does depends on the tokens before it. This points to using **conditional probability** to compute $P(w)$. That is, we can write:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(w) = P(w_1,\\ldots,w_n) = P(w_1) \\cdot P(w_2|w_1) \\cdot P(w_3|w_1,w_2) \\cdot\\ldots\\cdot P(w_n|w_1,\\ldots,w_{n-1})\n",
    "$$  \n",
    "This is also called the **chain rule** for probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** Consider the sentence \n",
    "\n",
    "<center><code>'when I drink Coke I smile'</code></center>\n",
    "    \n",
    "The probability that it occurs, according the the chain rule, is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(\\text{when}) \\cdot P(\\text{I | when}) \\cdot P(\\text{drink | when I})\\cdot P(\\text{Coke | when I drink}) \\cdot P(\\text{I | when I drink Coke}) \\cdot P(\\text{smile | when I drink Coke I})\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "That is, the probability that the sentence occurs is the product of the probability that each subsequent token follows the tokens that came before. For example, the probability $P(\\text{Coke | when I drink})$ is likely pretty high, as Coke is something that you drink. The probability $P(\\text{pizza | when I drink})$ is likely low, because pizza is not something that you drink.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may wonder how the language model \"knows\" that Coke is something that you drink, but pizza is not. The way that the language model \"learns\" its probabilities is by **looking at examples of existing sentences**, i.e. by being **trained on a corpus**. Throughout Parts 2 and 3, you will look at **different ways of estimating these probabilities**. In each case, you will use a corpus to assign probabilities to different tokens and combinations of tokens, and use those probabilities to generate new sentences.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Each language model you build will be a **class** with a few methods in common:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The `__init__` constructor: when you instantiate an LM object, you will need to pass the \"training corpus\" on which your model will be trained (i.e. a list of tokens you created in Question 2 with `tokenize`). The `train` method will then use that data to create a model which is saved in the `mdl` attribute. This code is given to you.\n",
    "* The `train` method takes in a list of tokens (e.g. the output of `tokenize`) and outputs a language model. **This language model is represented as a `Series`, whose index consists of tokens and whose values are the probabilities that the tokens occur.** (In the case of the N-Gram model in Part 3/Question 5, the model will be represented as a DataFrame instead of a Series – more on this later.)\n",
    "* The `probability` method takes in a sequence of tokens and returns the probability that this sequence occurs under the language model.\n",
    "* The `sample` method takes in a positive integer `M` and generates a string made up of `M` tokens using the language model. **This method generates random sentences!**\n",
    "\n",
    "The description of Question 3 walks through in detail how each of these methods work. However, here's the general workflow:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{initialize LM with tokenized corpus} \\rightarrow \\text{train LM (i.e. assign probabilities to each token) using corpus} \\rightarrow \\text{used trained LM to compute probabilities of input sentences and generate random sentences}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In Questions 3, 4, and 5, you will create classes for different language models – uniform, unigram, and N-Gram, respectively. In each class, you will implement each of the above methods."

    "### Question 3 – Uniform Language Models\n",
    "\n",
    "<a name='question3'></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "A uniform language model is one in which each **unique** token is equally likely to appear in any position, unconditional of any other information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's put into context what this means by using the following example corpus:\n",
    "\n",
    "```py\n",
    ">>> corpus = 'when I eat pizza, I smile, but when I drink Coke, my stomach hurts'\n",
    ">>> tokenize(corpus)\n",
    "['\\x02', 'when', 'I', 'eat', 'pizza', ',', 'I', 'smile', ',', 'but', 'when', 'I', 'drink', 'Coke', ',', 'my', 'stomach', 'hurts', '\\x03']\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a tokenized corpus, you need to build the language model itself in `train`. As mentioned above, language models are stored as Series, where words are the index and probabilities are the values. **In a uniform language model**, the probability assigned to each token is **1 over the total number of unique tokens in the corpus**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The example corpus above has 14 **unique** tokens. This means that we'd have $P(\\text{\\x02}) = \\frac{1}{14}$, $P(\\text{when}) = \\frac{1}{14}$, and so on. Specifically, in this example, **the Series that `train` returns should contain the following values**:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Token | Probability |\n",
    "| --- | --- |\n",
    "| `'\\x02'` | $\\frac{1}{14}$ |\n",
    "| `'when'` | $\\frac{1}{14}$ |\n",
    "| `'I'` | $\\frac{1}{14}$ |\n",
    "| `'eat'` | $\\frac{1}{14}$ |\n",
    "| `'pizza'` | $\\frac{1}{14}$ |\n",
    "| `','` | $\\frac{1}{14}$ |\n",
    "| `'smile'` | $\\frac{1}{14}$ |\n",
    "| `'but'` | $\\frac{1}{14}$ |\n",
    "| `'drink'` | $\\frac{1}{14}$ |\n",
    "| `'Coke'` | $\\frac{1}{14}$ |\n",
    "| `'my'` | $\\frac{1}{14}$ |\n",
    "| `'stomach'` | $\\frac{1}{14}$ |\n",
    "| `'hurts'` | $\\frac{1}{14}$ |\n",
    "| `'\\x03'` | $\\frac{1}{14}$ |\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that:\n",
    "- **None of the probabilities we computed are conditional – the uniform model does not use conditional probabilities!**\n",
    "- When looking at the Series that `train` returns (i.e. when looking at the `mdl` attribute), the `'\\x02'` and `'\\x03'` characters will show up as blank characters in the index. This is to be expected.\n",
    "- Your Series doesn't need to have the labels `'Token'` or `'Probability'` in it, like the above table does.\n",
    "\n",
    "After training the model, you need to implement two more methods, `probability` and `sample`.\n",
    "\n",
    "`probability` should take in any tuple of tokens and use the probabilities you computed in `train` (that are stored in the `mdl` attribute) to assign a probability to that sequence. For instance, suppose the input tuple is `('when', 'I', 'drink', 'Coke', 'I', 'smile')` (note that this tuple does not need to start with `'\\x02'` or end with `'\\x03'`). To compute the probability of this tuple under our language model, we would multiply the \"trained\" probabilities for each word individually. Here that would give us \n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(\\text{when I drink Coke I smile}) = P(\\text{when}) \\cdot P(\\text{I}) \\cdot P(\\text{drink}) \\cdot P(\\text{Coke}) \\cdot P(\\text{I}) \\cdot P(\\text{smile}) = \\left( \\frac{1}{14} \\right)^6$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that if the input tuple contains a token that was not in our corpus, `probability` should return 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, `sample` should take in a positive integer, `M`, and return a sentence made up of `M` randomly sampled tokens, in which the probabilities come from `mdl`. For instance, if `M=5`, then we'd return a sentence containing 5 randomly selected tokens from the table above, such that the probability that each token is selected is $\\frac{1}{14}$. The sampling is done with replacement, so we could end up with the same token multiple times. For instance, we might end up with `'but drink smile drink hurts'`. Note that this sentence doesn't make any grammatical sense (that's okay!) and that tokens are separated by spaces.\n",

    "## Part 3: Creating an N-Gram Language Model 📚\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recap\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's recap what we've done so far. Recall the chain rule for probability, where $w$ is a sentence made up of tokens $w_1, w_2, ..., w_n$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(w) = P(w_1,\\ldots,w_n) = P(w_1) \\cdot P(w_2|w_1) \\cdot P(w_3|w_1,w_2) \\cdot\\ldots\\cdot P(w_n|w_1,\\ldots,w_{n-1})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In Questions 3 (Uniform) and 4 (Unigram), your `train` methods computed these probabilities **unconditionally**, meaning that the probability that a token appeared in a sentence did **not depend** on the other tokens around it. That is, you said $P(w_i | w_1, w_2, ..., w_{i - 1}) = P(w_i)$. In Question 3, you let $P(w_i) = \\frac{1}{\\text{# unique tokens in corpus}}$, and in Question 4, you let $P(w_i) = \\frac{\\text{# tokens in corpus equal to $w_i$}}{\\text{# tokens in corpus}}$. Cruciually, each probability was determined by looking at the corpus that the model was trained on.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### N-Gram Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we will build an N-Gram language model, in which the probability of a token appearing in a sentence **does depend** on the tokens that come before it. \n",
    "\n",
    "The chain rule above specifies that the probability that a token occurs at in a particular position in a sentence depends on **all** previous tokens in the sentence. However, it is often the case that the likelihood that a token appears in a sentence is influenced more by **nearby** tokens. (Remember, tokens are words, punctuation, or `'\\x02'` / `'\\x03'`).\n",
    "\n",
    "The N-Gram language model relies on the assumption that only nearby tokens matter. Specifically, it assumes that the probability that a token occurs depends only on the previous $N-1$ tokens, rather than all previous tokens. That is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(w_n|w_1,\\ldots,w_{n-1}) = P(w_n|w_{n-(N-1)},\\ldots,w_{n-1})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In an N-Gram language model, there is a hyperparameter that we get to choose when creating the model, $N$. For any $N$, the resulting N-Gram model looks at the previous $N-1$ tokens when computing probabilities. (Note that the unigram model you built in Question 4 is really an N-Gram model with $N=1$, since it looked at 0 previous tokens when computing probabilities.)\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example: Trigram Model\n",
    "\n",
    "When $N=3$, we have a \"trigram\" model. Such a model looks at the previous $N-1 = 2$ tokens when computing probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the tuple `('when', 'I', 'drink', 'Coke', 'I', 'smile')`, corresponding to the sentence `'when I drink Coke I smile'`. Under the trigram model, the probability of this sentence is computed as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(\\text{when I drink Coke I smile}) = P(\\text{when}) \\cdot P(\\text{I | when}) \\cdot P(\\text{drink | when I}) \\cdot P(\\text{Coke | I drink}) \\cdot P(\\text{I | drink Coke}) \\cdot P(\\text{smile | Coke I})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The trigram model doesn't consider the beginning of the sentence when computing the probability that the sentence ends in `'smile'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### N-Grams\n",
    "\n",
    "Both when working with a training corpus and when implementing the `probability` method to compute the probabilities of other sentences, you will need to work with \"chunks\" of $N$ tokens at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition:** The **N-Grams of a text** are a list of tuples containing sliding windows of length $N$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, the trigrams in the sentence `'when I drink Coke I smile'` are:\n",
    "\n",
    "```py\n",
    "[('when', 'I', 'drink'), ('I', 'drink', 'Coke'), ('drink', 'Coke', 'I'), ('Coke', 'I', 'smile')]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Computing N-Gram Probabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice in our trigram model above, we computed $P(\\text{when I drink Coke I smile})$ as being the product of several conditional probabilities. These conditional probabilities are the result of **training** our N-Gram model on a training corpus.\n",
    "\n",
    "To train an N-Gram model, we must compute a conditional probability for every $N$-token sequence in the corpus. For instance, suppose again that we are training a trigram model. Then, for every 3-token sequence $w_1, w_2, w_3$, we must compute $P(w_3 | w_1, w_2)$. To do so, we use:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(w_3 | w_1, w_2) = \\frac{C(w_1, w_2, w_3)}{C(w_1, w_2)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $C(w_1, w_2, w_3)$ is the number of occurrences of the trigram sequence $w_1, w_2, w_3$ in the training corpus and $C(w_1, w_2)$ is the number of occurrences of the bigram sequence  $w_1, w_2$ in the training corpus. (Technical note: the probabilities that we compute using the ratios of counts are _estimates_ of the true conditional probabilities of N-Grams in the population of corpuses from which our corpus was drawn.)\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, for any $N$, conditional probabilities are computed by dividing the counts of N-Grams by the counts of the (N-1)-Grams they follow. \n",
    "\n",
    "**In the description of Question 5.2 we provide a detailed example of how we might compute such probabilities.**\n",

    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### The `NGramLM` Class\n",
    "\n",
    "The `NGramLM` class contains a few extra methods and attributes beyond those of `UniformLM` and `UnigramLM`:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Instantiating `NGramLM` requires both a list of tokens and a positive integer `N`, specifying the N in N-grams. This parameter is stored in an attribute `N`.\n",
    "1. The `NGramLM` class has a method `create_ngrams` that takes in a list of tokens and returns a list of N-Grams (recall from above, an N-Gram is a **tuple** of length N). This list of N-Grams is then passed to the `train` method to train the N-Gram model.\n",
    "1. While the `train` method still creates a language model (in this case, an N-Gram model) and stores it in the `mdl` attribute, this model is most naturally stored as a DataFrame. This DataFrame will have three columns:\n",
    "    - `'ngram'`, containing the N-Grams found in the text.\n",
    "    - `'n1gram'`, containing the (N-1)-Grams upon which the N-Grams in `ngram` are built.\n",
    "    - `'prob'`, containing the probabilities of each N-Gram in `ngram`.\n",
    "1. The `NGramLM` class has an attribute `prev_mdl` that stores an (N-1)-Gram language model over the same corpus (which in turn will store an (N-2)-Gram language model over the same corpus, and so on). This is necessary to compute the probability that a word occurs at the start of a text. This code is included for you in the constructor."

    "0. The first character in the output is `'\\x02'`, as specified above. **We won't count this starting `'\\x02'` in the length of our output string**, so we still need to find 5 more tokens.\n",
    "1. The next character needs to be either `'zebras'` or `'cows'`, since `('\\x02', 'zebras')` and `('\\x02', 'cows')` are the only **bigrams** in `short_tokens` that start with an `'\\x02'`. $P(\\text{zebras | \\x02})$ is $\\frac{2}{3}$ and $P(\\text{cows | \\x02})$ is $\\frac{1}{3}$, so we select either `'zebras'` or `'cows'` for our next token according to these probabilities. For the sake of example, suppose we select `'cows'`. 4 more tokens to go.\n",
    "2. Now, we must look for **trigrams** that start with the bigram `('\\x02', 'cows')`. There is just one, `('\\x02', 'cows', 'eat')`, so our next token must be `'eat'`. 3 more tokens to go.\n",
    "3. Now, we must look for **trigrams** that start with the bigram `('cows', 'eat')`. Again, there is just one, `('cows', 'eat', 'green')`, so our next token must be `'green'`. 2 more tokens to go.\n",
    "4. Now, we must look for **trigrams** that start with the bigram `('eat', 'green')`. There are three options – `('eat', 'green', 'peas')`, `('eat', 'green', 'grass')`, and `('eat', 'green', 'peppers')`. Since $P(\\text{peas | eat green}) = P(\\text{grass | eat green}) = P(\\text{peppers | eat green}) = \\frac{1}{3}$, we pick either `'peas'`, `'grass'`, or `'peppers'` uniformly at random. For the sake of example, suppose we select `'peppers'`. 1 more token to go.\n",
    "5. We must end the output string now with `'\\x03'`, putting us at `'\\x02'` plus 5 tokens, which is the number of tokens we were told to sample. Note that `'\\x03'` **does** count towards the number of tokens we were asked to sample. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our result is `'\\x02 cows eat green peppers \\x03'`, this is 5 tokens excluding the initial `'\\x02'`. **Note that in our training corpus we never encountered an instance of cows 🐄 eating green peppers 🫑, but we were able to generate a coherent sentence in which they did – pretty cool!**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Some additional guidance:\n",
    "- Only the initial `'\\x02'` token is not counted for the number of tokens generated, every subsequent `'\\x02'` or `'\\x03'` token you generate will count towards that total (including the mandatory final `'\\x03'`).\n",
    "- If you run into a situation where there are no N-Grams that match the most recent (N-1)-Gram, you should add `'\\x03'` (STOP) token as the next token in your output sentence. There is a chance that your sampled sentence ends in many `'\\x03'`s, and that's fine.\n",
    "- Helper functions and recursion will be very helpful.\n",
    "- You will not be tested for a case where `M` (the number of tokens you should generate) is less than `N` from your ngrams.\n",
    "\n",
    "After you've understood the above example, complete the implementation of the `sample` method in `NGramLM`."
